df_r <- as.tibble(df_r)

# categorical data --------------------------------------------------------------
#has no rankings or order
#qualitative data that are classed
#creating vectors

#electronics

#people
people_r <- (c("ugly", "sexy","beutiful"))

# ordinal data ------------------------------------------------------------
# are data that are classed according to ranks 
#eg. position 1st 2nd 3rd
#this is still qualitative but with some sougt of order
#ordinal scale  or importance of a vector according to rank

# character data ----------------------------------------------------------

# Chapter3 DESCRIPTIVE STATS ----------------------------------------------------------------

#create a data frame

#count the data

# or 
#look in environment .obs


# measures of central tendency --------------------------------------------

#means
#medians 
#Skewness


#calc mean weight
chicks %>% 
  summarise(mean.wt = mean(weight))

#be more specific and look at a specific time 
#create a new data set with variables to be considered
 chicks %>% 
  filter(Time == 21) %>% #select all time 21 
  group_by(Diet) %>%  #group data by Diets
  summarise(mean.wt = mean(weight),median.wt = median(weight))

 
#visualising density of data

ggplot(data = filter(chicks, Time == 21), aes(x = weight, fill = Diet)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) 
#no y variable because its a density graph which is similiar to a hiostogram

#skewness
#when graph is higher on the left = skewed to the right (+ skewed)
#when graph is higher on the right = Skewed to the left (- skewed)



library(e1071) #load this to measure skewness

#creating data for mean, median and skewness in weight for every type of Diet give to chickens
chicks %>% 
  filter(Time == 21) %>% 
  group_by(Diet) %>% 
  summarise(mean.wt = mean(weight),
            median.wt = median(weight),
            skew.wt = skewness(weight))
#skewness is the degree of assymetry present in the distribution when the mode, mean and median are not equal.


#kurtosis
#Kurtosis describes the tail shape of the dataâ€™s distribution. 
#A normal distribution has zero kurtosis and thus the standard tail shape (mesokurtic).
#Negative kurtosis indicates data with a thin-tailed (platykurtic) distribution.
#Positive kurtosis indicates a fat-tailed distribution (leptokurtic)

#calc the kurtosis of tail distribution

chicks %>% 
  filter(Time == 21) %>% 
  group_by(Diet) %>% 
  summarise(mean.wt = mean(weight),

            kurt.wt = kurtosis(weight))

#The variance and standard deviation are examples of interval estimates.
